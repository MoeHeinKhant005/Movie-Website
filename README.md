# CiNEMAX - Movie Website

This is a fully functional movie website made with **Vanilla Frontend Technologies** that is fully responsive on every screen. I made the codebase clean, fast and modular by separating the CSS and Javascript files into their small chunks of functions. I programmed this website only using vanilla technologies without using any kind of frameworks or library to show off my Frontend Web Development Skills.
